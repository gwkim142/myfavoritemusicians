  <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <p>On a dark desert highway,<br>cool wind in my hair<br>Warm smell of "colitas"<br>rising up through the air<br>Up ahead in the distance,<br>I saw a shimmering light<br>My head grew heavy and<br>my sight grew dimmer<br>I had to stop for the night<br>There she stood in the doorway<br>I heard the mission bell<br>And I was thinking to myself,<br>'This could be heaven<br>or this could be hell'<br>Then she lit up a candle<br>and she showed me the way<br>There were voices down the corridor,<br>I thought I heard them say<br>"Welcome to the Hotel California"<br>Such a lovely place<br>Such a lovely face<br>Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>Any time of year, you can find it here<br>
