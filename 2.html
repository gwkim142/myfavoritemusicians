  <h3>Lyrics</h3>
  <p>Is this the real life <br>Is this just fantasy <br>Caught in a landslide <br>No escape from reality <br>Open your eyes <br>Look up to the skies and see <br>I’m just a poor boy,I need no sympathy <br>Because I’m easy come, easy go, <br>A little high, little low, <br>Anyway the wind blows, doesn’t really matter to me, <br>Mama just killed a man<br>Put a gun against his head<br>Pulled my trigger now he`s dead<br>Mama life had just begun<br>But now I`ve gone and thrown it all away -<br>Mama wooo<br>Didn`t mean to make you cry -<br>Carry on carry on as if nothing really matters -<br>
